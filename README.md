# The Pagoda

## Basis of the Game

The Pagoda is based off the Channel 4 gameshow The Circle, where people are put against each other to be voted most popular.
The game can have up to 100 people, with the gameplay split into days.
Each day, players can talk with up to 8 other players, to try and become the most popular.
At the end of each day, players vote on their three favourite people, with the worst being removed from the game.

The twist is that you can be whoever you want to.
Nobody knows your true identity, so you can be whoever you want to.
